# Stroke-analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Stroke Overview Dashboard** designed to analyze stroke prevalence and associated health risk factors across different populations. The dashboard compares **rural and urban** populations while highlighting key risk indicators such as hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, age group, and work type.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze total stroke cases and stroke rate across populations
- Compare stroke prevalence between rural and urban areas
- Examine the relationship between stroke and hypertension
- Identify high-risk age groups for stroke and hypertension
- Explore health risk factors including smoking status and heart disease

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** for data modeling and interactive visualization
- **Excel / CSV** for data preparation
- **GitHub** for version control and portfolio hosting

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Displayed
- Total number of patients
- Total stroke cases
- Stroke rate percentage
- Hypertension count by gender
- Hypertension level by age group

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Rural vs Urban population segmentation
- Stroke cases distribution by work type
- Stroke rate comparison by hypertension status
- Health risk analysis by smoking status
- Heart disease distribution by marital status
- Gender-based hypertension analysis
- Age group segmentation for hypertension prevalence

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Stroke rates are higher among individuals with hypertension
- Urban populations show a slightly higher stroke rate compared to rural populations
- Older adults represent the most affected age group
- Hypertension prevalence varies significantly by gender and age group
- Smoking status is associated with increased health risks
